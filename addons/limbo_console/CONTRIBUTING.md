# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing. Please follow these guidelines to keep the project consistent and maintainable in the long-term.

## Vision

- This is a simple text-based interface. Follow the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) – keep the code simple and easy to maintain, abstractions minimal, and the API easy to use without reading a manual.
- Don't run any logic if the console is closed or hidden.

## Code Style & Recommendations

- Follow the official [GDScript Style Guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html).
- Use [static typing](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/static_typing.html) wherever possible.
- Apply the 80/20 rule: if a feature only benefits a small number of users, make it optional or don’t include it.
- To avoid unnecessary whitespace changes, please enable this setting in Godot: `Editor Settings > Text Editor > Behavior > Files > Trim Trailing Whitespace on Save`
