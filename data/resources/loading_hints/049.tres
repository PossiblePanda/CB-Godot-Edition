After contact with SCP-049's hand(s), the victim (hereafter referred to as SCP-049-2) suffers [DATA EXPUNGED] and dies within moments.", "SCP-049 then produces a bag made of [DATA EXPUNGED] containing scalpels, needle, thread, and several vials of an as-yet-unidentified substance and begins dissecting SCP-049-2, as well as inserting various chemicals into the body.
